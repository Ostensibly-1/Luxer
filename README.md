# Luxer
A simple, tiny, fast, and (almost) flawless Lua 5.1 Lexer.
Keep it neat, and see what you only need to see, only on Luxer ;3
### Note: This is not a module, this is a simple Go learning project that I wanted to show to the public.
## Usage
```go
lexerObj := luxer.NewLexer()
lexerObj.Lex(string(content))
```
### License: The Unlicense
Feel free to use this code everywhere if you want
### Made By Ostensibly
PS: I'm learning the Go programming language and wanted to see if I could integrate some Lua stuff to it, I can! Also this Lexer was made for my Lua Obfuscator "Lucine" which will release soon! Learn more about it on https://lucine.vercel.app/
